Some features, such as voicemail to text, are unique to cloud-based phone systems. A micro-sized office could manage quickly with the bare-bones Office Pro setup, but the sophisticated functions of Office Pro Plus and Office Business are tempting for a few dollars more: the Nextiva mobile voice and video app and the Team Presence status indication (both consisted of in Office Pro Plus) work upgrades, as are call recording and the number-meshing Nextiva Anyplace app (Office Enterprise).</p>
