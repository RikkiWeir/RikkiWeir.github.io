There are 2 fundamental types of PBX servers-- those for traditional PBX systems operating over phone lines, and those for IP PBX phone systems operating over the internet.</p>
<p>Business VoIP providers can use the same service, and a lot more features, than a traditional PBX at a portion of the expense by hosting the solution on their own data centers and providing the platform over the internet. Now that we have actually taken a thorough look at VoIP, how it works, and what function VoIP Phone Systems have to play in our future as services, you should be equipped with sufficient understanding to begin believing seriously about how your business will execute it.</p>
