<p>The second factor is since VoIP unlocks for Cloud Hosted Phone systems, which get rid of the need for a large PBX box in your office. Everything a traditional small business PBX can do, Cloud Based Small Business PBXA hosted PBX can do better. 8 Ã— 8 is a VoIP system that uses all of the texting, voicemail, and calling functions discovered in the majority of other solutions on the marketplace.

For instance, an automobile attendant notifies consumers which departments to reach by pressing the corresponding secret on their phone.</p>

At ServiceMark, we are strong proponents of hosted, cloud based telephone system solutions.
